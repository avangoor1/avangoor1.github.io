        <h1> <center>Welcome to PF1 Lab</center> <br>
        Mark your name off on the attendance sheet at the front.
        <br>
        You will be working on Lab 5, which deals with do-while and for loops. <br>
        <br>
        When you are done with 5a, 5b, and 5c: <br>
        1) <u>Print the report to save as a pdf and attach it in your blackboard section.</u><br>
        2) You don't have to show me the autograded report. As you leave, let me know your name, so I can mark you down as present for today.<br>
        <br>My office hours are every Tuesday 11am-12pm and 2-3pm. They will be on Zoom, and the link is posted on Blackboard under the Office Hours section.<br> 
        <br> 
        I have graded homework project 1. It you have any questions about it, please feel free to ask me!   - Ananya (uh-nan-ya)
